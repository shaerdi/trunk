jcfPM folder contains files illustrating how Law2_ScGeom_JCFpmPhys_JointedCohesiveFrictionalPM can be used to deal with jointed media (media containing pre-existing discontinuity surfaces (fractures)).

1-packInGtsSurface.py is a simple script used to generate a packing (parallellepiped_10.spheres) from a meshed closed surface (parallellepiped.gts).
Packing generation can be done with other methods. The point here is to generate a packing and to save it in a text file (parallellepiped_10.spheres).

2-identificationSpheresOnJoint.py is a script used to identify the spheres belonging to a predefined packing (parallellepiped_10.spheres) interacting along pre-existing discontinuity surfaces defined by a meshed surface (persistentPlane30Deg.stl). Executing this script produces 2 text files containing respectively spheres from packing (parallellepiped_10_persistentPlane30Deg.spheres) and spheres attributes regarding jcfPM variables (parallellepiped_10_persistentPlane30Deg_jointedPM.spheres). 

3-gravityLoading.py is a simple example showing how to use Law2_ScGeom_JCFpmPhys_JointedCohesiveFrictionalPM. It simulates the loading of a pre-fractured packing (parallellepiped_10_persistentPlane30Deg.spheres) by gravity to emphasize how the pre-existing discontinuity affects the behavior. User can play along with joint surface properties (smooth contact logic or not, joint friction angle,...) to see the effect on the simulated behavior.
